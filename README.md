For the inversion, there is a long list of software that can handle IP data:
* res2dinv / res3dinv (M.H. Loke, now Aarhus GeoSoftware)
* resipy (G. Blanchy)
* SimPEG (Cockett, Kang, Heagy)
* pyGIMLi / pyBERT (Rücker, Günther, Wagner): pygimli.org
* AarhusInv and Aarhus Workbench
* EEMVerter (Fiandaca et al.)
* ...
